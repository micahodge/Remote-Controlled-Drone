### [YouTube Demonstration of Remote-Controlled Drone](https://youtu.be/VHeIm9Jk6Hc)

<h2>Description</h2>
<br><br>
This drone is controlled by my laptop through a Bluetooth chip on the drone. This drone is made using brushless motors, a 4in1 ESC, an Arduino 2560, a gyroscope chip on a breadboard, and a lot of wires. The code for this project is the flight controller code that is programmed on the Arduino. The drone is controlled through a Microsoft Visual Studio window that I created for this project, which is also shown. The window gives buttons to the user that send commands to the drone to either lower, hover, or lift itself. The Arduino is powered through a 9V battery, and the motors are powered by a 3S LiPo battery. For the protection of the propellers, there are 3D-designed and printed propeller guards that are epoxyed onto the body near the propellers. The entire body of the drone was also 3D designed and printed custom for this project. There were two designs of the body throughout this project, with the second being a more secure version than the first to prevent unpredictable behaviors, such as, for example, propeller arms moving slightly. Both body designs are shown in the video. The entire drone weighs about 700 grams, with the max thrust of the motors being about 1760 grams, giving the drone around a 2.5/1 thrust-to-weight ratio.
