<h1>Remote-Controlled Drone</h1>

### [YouTube Demonstration of Remote-Controlled Drone](https://youtu.be/VHeIm9Jk6Hc)

<h2>Description</h2>
This drone is controlled by my laptop through a Bluetooth chip on the drone. This drone is made using brushless motors, a 4in1 ESC, an Arduino 2560, a gyroscope chip on a breadboard, and a lot of wires. The code for this project is the flight controller code that is programmed on the Arduino. The drone is controlled through a Microsoft Visual Studio window that I created for this project, which is also shown. The window gives buttons to the user that send commands to the drone to either lower, hover, or lift itself. The Arduino is powered through a 9V battery, and the motors are powered by a 3S LiPo battery. For the protection of the propellers, there are 3D-designed and printed propeller guards that are epoxyed onto the body near the propellers. The entire body of the drone was also 3D designed and printed custom for this project. There were two designs of the body throughout this project, with the second being a more secure version than the first to prevent unpredictable behaviors, such as, for example, propeller arms moving slightly. Both body designs are shown in the video. The entire drone weighs about 700 grams, with the max thrust of the motors being about 1760 grams, giving the drone around a 2.5/1 thrust-to-weight ratio.

<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>

Because of the 2.5-week timeline I was given to complete this project, in the end, I struggled with a lot of small problems. The main problems had to do with the flight controller and getting the adjusting factors to be just right. It took a lot of attempts, and as you can see in the video, while testing to see which constant values I should use for the flight controller, it made the drone crash a couple of times, which only prolonged the process. By the end of the time period, the best I had come up with was the ability for the drone to be able to hover right above the ground, but I was too nervous to get it higher, considering I did not have time to crash it again. For a while, I figured it was a mix between the weight distribution on the drone and the flight controller not being perfect, but the more I tried to fix the weight distribution by moving parts around the drone, none of it seemed to help. When I come back home to Florida after working at NASA, I plan to continue working on this project. The end goal is to be able to do all of the commands smoothly through my laptop, which is lowering, hovering, and lifting itself with stability and without worry.
